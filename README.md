ComputerCraft Repo
==================

I am playing around with this little mod in Minecraft, called ComputerCraft.
It adds computers and basic robots programmable in Lua.
Yes, I know this mod is several years old, and that OpenComputers exists now,
but I have never gotten into CC, and I would still like to.
Not to mention my friends and I are starting a server with Lipito's Galacticraft Modpack, and I think a strong CC knowledge will help us out big time.

My plan is to keep all the code on this repo, so that I never have to use the CC editor, and also so it is version controlled.
In order to get code from this repo onto your turtle/computer, open up its terminal, and enter `wget <URL-to-file> <filename-on-turtle>`, and then run that filelike any other program on your turtle.
